    Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Judahsan and I'm the creator of this space. 
    I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in data science, and I've always been 
    passionate about using technology to create and solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy 
    bingewatching One Piece and Modern Family, going to the orchestra, and sharing memes with 
    my friends. As a developer, my ultimate goal is to create a multi platform RPG game. 
    </p>

    I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge with others, 
    and I hope you find something here that interests you. Thank you for visiting and I hope 
    you have a great time exploring my blog. If you have any questions or just want to say hello,
